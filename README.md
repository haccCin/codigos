# codigos
The call to the code needs to follow the hierarchy sequence present in the repository. In the 'mainRaInt' file directory, run that file by calling it by its name.

When executing the code, folders named 'exec_x' will be created, where 'x' is the order number of the library that is being omitted, following the order:

1 - Americium
2 - Cobalt
3 - Cesium
4 - Sodium.

In each of the 'exec_x' folders, 30 rounds of the algorithm are programmed in order to determine the weight fraction of the missing compound, as well as the weight fraction of the determined libraries.
